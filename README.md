##Hacking the editor
In this editor, all is **plugin**
You can extend the editor as well as the UI itself.

You can :

- [x] inherits from default plugins to Xtends them.
- [x] override default plugins functions with yours. No need to duplicate a plugin to make a fix or an enhancement.
This way, even if the offical plugin is updated, you can still use yours with your functions
