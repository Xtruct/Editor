# Xtruct Editor - *The hackable 2D Game Editor*
### Part of [Xtruct](https://github.com/Xtruct/Xtruct)


##Hacking the editor
In this editor, everything is a **plugin**

You can extend the editor as well as the UI itself.

You can :

- [x] inherits from default plugins to Xtends them.
- [x] override default plugins functions with yours. No need to duplicate a plugin to make a fix or an enhancement.
This way, even if the offical plugin is updated, you can still use yours with your functions
